## Description

The purpose of this project was to create an app for users to search for animals and zookeepers in a catalog and to be able to add animals and zookepers. I learned how to use Heroku, Insomnia, JavaScript, Express.js, HTML, CSS, Object-Oriented Programming, and Test-Driven Development to build and test an application.
